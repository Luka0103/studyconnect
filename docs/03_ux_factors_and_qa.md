# Task 3 - UX Factors and Quality Assurance

## 3.1 UX Factors Overview
From all of the given aspects mentioned in the article, we decided on the following five in order of importance:
1. Trust/Credibility
2. Intuitive operation
3. Controllability/Dependability
4. Efficiency
5. Appearance/Attractiveness


### Trust/Credibility: 
*The product appears trustworthy to the user.*

Trust is by far the most important factor for us; everyone ranked it either first or second in their personal ranking. This is simply because trust is the most important issue, taking precedence over every other aspect, including use. 

A loss of trust also has consequences on many other factors mentioned in the text.
How could a potential customer use an application or service that treats their personal data carelessly, thereby undermining trust in the product?

Zoom is one example. It grew massively at the start of the pandemic, but due to safety concerns and incidents such as 'Zoom-bombing', it could not maintain its popularity.


### Intuitive Operation: 
*The user is able to operate the product with their present skills immediately and without any training or instruction by others.*

The barrier to entry for a product should be relatively low, we can't use software engineering students as a benchmark. Programs should be somehow intuitive even for people like our parents and grandparents. For StudyConnect, we can assume that the target group has a certain level of technical knowledge.

In other words, how appealing would a product seem to a potential user who has to read through a lengthy documentary and/or watch several Youtube tutorials just to find a specific function. There are two aspects that can be viewed under this factor.
- UI: The function may be easily accessible, however the UI does not reflect this simple approach and/or even has some bugs.
- Functionality: Even with well-designed UI it can be counterintuitive for certain functions to be hidden in menus and sub-menus, which can lead to a bad user experience.

Duolingo is a good example of an app with intuitive operation. This language learning app is designed for immediate use without instructions. Its clear layout and gamification elements guide users naturally through the lessons.


### Controllability/Dependability
*The product always responds to user interaction in a predictable and consistent way.*

When using a product, it is important that the same action x leads to the same result y, hence reflecting a consistent workflow. The absence of controllability can be a major factor for frustration, when a consistent result cannot be expected from repeated actions.

Another (technical) aspect that needs to be considered: Limited controllability/dependability may hinder the identification and understanding of errors, especially for users with limited technical knowledge.

A good example of controllability and dependability is Microsoft Word. It has maintained consistent functionality and predictable behavior for many years. The same actions always produce the same results, therefore users get used to the workflows across different versions.



### Efficiency 
*The user can reach their goals with minimum time required and minimum physical effort.*

Humans are lazy. Therefore, we prefer to perform important actions with the least possible effort. Take the action of playing a specific song for example. On Spotify, this can be achieved with just a few clicks via a simple search, or even automatically via personalized playlists. By contrast, older or less optimized music platforms often require users to navigate through multiple menus or manually browse long lists to find the desired track.


### Appearance/Attractiveness: 
*The product is attractive, beautiful and/or designed in an appealing way.*

Of all selected factors, almost all group members ranked appearance/attractiveness towards the bottom. One possible explanation is the fact that as a software engineer student we all view things mostly from a technical perspective and, maybe neglecting design elements to a certain degree.

However, appearance is still considered an important factor. The SquirrelMail program used at Hochschule Esslingen is a prime negative example. Although it has all the functions required of a simple webmail application, due to it's outdated look and feel it is not very popular among many students.
